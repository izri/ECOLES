11 This section describes traffic models in detail. A major objective of system simulations is 
12 to provide the operator with a view of the maximum number of active users that can be 
13 supported for a given service under a specified configuration at a given coverage level. 
14 The traffic generated by a service should be accurately modeled in order to evaluate the 
15 performance of a system. This may be a time consuming exercise. Traffic modeling can 
16 be simplified, as explained below, by not modeling the user arrival process and 
17 assuming full queue traffic which is considered as the baseline. Modeling non-full-queue 
18 traffic is also discussed in the subsections that follow. 
19 
20 Modeling of user arrival process: Typically all users are not active at a given time and 
21 even the active users might not register for the same service. In order to avoid different 
22 user registration and demand models, the objective of the proposed simulation model is 
23 restricted to evaluate the performance with the users that are maintaining a session with 
24 transmission activity. This model can be used to determine the number of such 
25 registered users that can be supported. This document does not address the arrival 
26 process of such registered users, i.e. it does not address the statistics of subscribers 
27 that register and become active. 
28 
29 Full Queue model: In the full queue user traffic model, all the users in the system always 
30 have data to send or receive. In other words, there is always a constant amount of data 
31 that needs to be transferred, in contrast to bursts of data that follow an arrival process. 
32 This model allows the assessment of the spectral efficiency of the system independent 
33 of actual user traffic distribution type. A user is in outage if residual PER after HARQ 
34 retransmissions exceeds TBD.

1 In the following sections, we will concentrate on traffic generation only for the non-full 
2 queue case. In addition, the interaction of the generated traffic with the higher layer 
3 protocol stack such as TCP is not fully included here. Instead, we will provide 
4 references to document which provide the detailed TCP transport layer implementation 
5 and its interaction with the various traffic models.

7 The models described in this section shall be used for evaluating 802.16m proposals. 
8 Optionally, for liaison with NGMN, statistical traffic models and associated parameters 
9 defined in [69] or its latest revision may be used for system performance evaluation. 
10 10.1. Web Browsing (HTTP) Traffic Model 
11 HTTP traffic characteristics are governed by the structure of the web pages on the 
12 World Wide Web (WWW), and the nature of human interaction. The nature of human 
13 interaction with the WWW causes the HTTP traffic to have a bursty profile, where the 
14 HTTP traffic is characterized by ON/OFF periods as shown in Figure 17. 
15

Session Session 

16 
17 Figure 17: HTTP Traffic Pattern 

18 
19 The ON periods represent the sequence of packets in which the web page is being 
20 transferred from source to destination; while the OFF periods represent the time the 
21 user spends reading the webpage before transitioning to another page. This time is also 
22 known as Reading Time [43][44]. 
23 
24 The amount of information passed from the source to destination during the ON period 
25 is governed by the web page structure. A webpage is usually composed of a main 
26 object and several embedded objects. The size of the main object, in addition to the 
27 number and size of the embedded objects define the amount of traffic passed from 
28 source to destination. 
29 In summary, the HTTP traffic model is defined by the following parameters: 
30 SM: Size of main object in page 
31 Nd: Number of embedded objects in a page 
32 SE: Size of an embedded object in page 
33 Dpc: Reading time 
34 Tp: Parsing time for the main page 
35 
36 In addition to the model parameters, HTTP traffic behavior is also dependent on the 
37 HTTP version used. Currently HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 are widely used by servers and 
38 browsers [45]-[48]. In HTTP 1.0, also known as burst mode transfer, a distinct TCP 
39 connection is used for each object in the page, thereby facilitating simultaneous transfer 
40 of objects. The maximum number of simultaneous TCP connections is configurable, 
41 with most browsers using a maximum of 4 simultaneous TCP connections. In HTTP/1.1, 

93 



2007-08-28 IEEE C802.16m-07/080r3 

1 also known as persistent mode transfer, all objects are transferred serially over a single 

2 persistent TCP connection. Recent measurement and analysis for web page structures 

3 can be found in [58]. These measurements have been performed using a recent online


4 traffic analysis provided by market research firm ComScore Media Metrix, which 

5 examined the number of visitors among the 50 top Web sites on January 2007 [59]. 

6 The paper [58], includes web page sizes and compositions of the 50 top web sites after 

7 analyzing 25000 measurements, and each web site has been visited 500 times for three 

8 weeks from April 7 to April 23 in 2007. Web site visits are about one minute apart, and 

9 visits to the same website are about an hour apart. Table 27 provides the model 
10 parameters for HTTP traffic for downlink and uplink connections based on the 
11 measurements in [59] and the model in [48]-[49].

4 To request an HTTP session, the client sends an HTTP request packet, which has a 
5 constant size of 350 bytes. From the statistics presented in the literature, a 50%-50% 
6 distribution of HTTP versions between HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 has been found to 
7 closely approximate web browsing traffic in the internet [49]. 
8 
9 Further studies also showed that the maximum transmit unit (MTU) sizes most common 
10 to in the internet are 576 bytes and 1500 bytes (including the TCP header) with a 
11 distribution of 24% and 76% respectively. Thus, the web traffic generation process can 
12 be described as in Figure 18.

18 A user is defined in outage for HTTP service if the average packet call throughput is 
19 less than the minimum average throughput requirement of 128 kbps. The system 
20 outage requirement is such that no more than 3% of users can be in outage. The air link 
21 PER of MAC SDUs for HTTP traffic should be not be greater than 1%.

1 10.1.1. HTTP and TCP interactions for DL HTTP traffic 
2 Two versions of the HTTP protocol, HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1, are widely used by 
3 servers and browsers. Users shall specify 50% HTTP/1.0 and 50% HTTP/1.1 for HTTP 
4 traffic. For people who have to model the actual interaction between HTTP traffic and 
5 the underling TCP connection, refer to 4.1.3.2, 4.2.4.3 of [50] for details. 

6 10.1.2. HTTP and TCP interactions for UL HTTP traffic 
7 HTTP/1.1 is used for UL HTTP traffic. For details regarding the modeling of the 
8 interaction between HTTP traffic and the underling TCP connection, refer to 4.2.4.1, 

9 4.2.4.2 of [50]. 
10 10.2. File Transfer Protocol Model 
11 File transfer traffic is characterized by a session consisting of a sequence of file 
12 transfers, separated reading times. Reading time is defined as the time between end of 
13 transfer of the first file and the transfer request for the next file. The packet call size is 
14 therefore equivalent to the file size and the packet call inter-arrival time is the reading 
15 time. A typical FTP session is shown in Figure 19.

17 Figure 19: FTP Traffic Patterns 
18 
19 Table 28 provides the model parameters for FTP traffic that includes file downloads as 
20 well as uploads [51]-[52].In the case of file uploads, the arrival of new users is Poisson 
21 distributed and each user transfers a single file before leaving the network. 
22 
23 The FTP traffic generation process is described in Figure 20. Based on the results on 
24 packet size distribution, 76% of the files are transferred using and MTU of 1500 bytes 
25 and 24% of the files are transferred using an MTU of 576 bytes. Note that these two 
26 packet sizes also include a 40 byte IP packet header and this header overhead for the 
27 appropriate number of packets must be added to the file sizes calculated from the 
28 statistical distributions in Table 28. For each file transfer a new TCP connection is used 
29 whose initial congestion window size is 1 segment. 
30 
31 A user is defined in outage for FTP service if the average packet call throughput is less 
32 than the minimum average throughput requirement of 128 kbps. The system outage 
33 requirement is such that no more than 3% of users can be in outage. The air link PER of 
34 MAC SDUs for FTP traffic should be not be greater than 1%.

7 10.2.1. TCP Modeling 
8 The widespread use of TCP as a transport protocol in the internet requires an accurate 
9 model of TCP behavior to better characterize traffic flow. The major behaviors that need 
10 to be accounted for in the TCP model are the session establishment and release and 
11 TCP slow start. 

97 



2007-08-28 IEEE C802.16m-07/080r3 
1 10.2.1.1. TCP Session Establishment and Release 
2 TCP uses a 3-way handshake to establish and release a TCP session. The sequences 
3 of establishing and releasing a TCP session on the downlink and the uplink are shown 
4 in Figure 21 and Figure 22 respectively. 
5 
6 A TCP session is established by the transmitter sending a 40 byte SYNC control 
7 segment to the remote server. In response, the server sends a 40 byte SYNC/ACK 
8 control segment. The final acknowledgement is sent by the transmitter by setting the 
9 ACK flag in the first TCP segment of the TCP session, which is then started in slow start 
10 mode [62]. 
11 
12 The TCP session is released by the transmitter setting the FIN flag in the last TCP 
13 segment. In response, the receiver sends by a FIN/ACK control segment. The session 
14 is concluded by the transmitter sending a final ACK message [62].

3 10.2.1.2. TCP Slow Start Modeling 
4 TCP slow start is part of the congestion control mechanism implemented in the TCP 
5 protocol. Congestion control is implemented using a window flow control mechanism, 
6 which tracks the maximum amount of unacknowledged or outstanding data at the 
7 transmitter. 
8 
9 The amount of outstanding data that can be sent without receiving an acknowledgement 
10 (ACK) is determined by the minimum of the congestion window size and the receiver 
11 window size. After the TCP session is established, the transfer of data starts in slow1
2 start mode with an initial congestion window size of 1 segment. The congestion window 
13 size is subsequently increased by one with each arriving ACK for a successfully 
14 received packet. This increase occurs regardless of whether the packet is correctly 
15 received or not, and regardless of whether the packet is out of order or not. This results 
16 in an exponential growth of the congestion window. 
17 
18 Figure 23 explains the packet transmission sequence in a TCP session. The round trip 
19 time (RTT) for the TCP slow start model consists of: 
20 
21 RTT= ..1+ ..2 

99 



2007-08-28 IEEE C802.16m-07/080r3 

where: 

..1: Time taken by an ACK packet to travel from the client (server) to Base Station + 
Time taken by an ACK packet to travel from Base Station to server (client) + Time taken 
by TCP segment to travel from server (client) to Base Station. 

..2: Time taken by ACK segment to travel from Base Station to Client (server). 

..1 is assumed to be a random variable of exponential distribution, while ..2 is 
determined by the air link throughput . This model only accounts for the slow start 
process, while congestion control and avoidance have not been modeled. Additionally, 
the receiver window size is assumed to be large, and thus not a limiting factor.

4 VoIP refers to real-time delivery of voice packet across networks using the Internet 
5 protocols. A VoIP session is defined as the entire user call time and VoIP session 
6 occurs during the whole simulation period. 
7 
8 There are a variety of encoding schemes for voice (i.e., G.711, G.722, G.722.1, 
9 G.723.1, G.728, G.729, and AMR) that result in different bandwidth requirements. 
10 Including the protocol overhead, it is very common for a VoIP call to require between 5 
11 Kbps and 64 Kbps of bi-directional bandwidth. 
12 10.3.1. Basic Voice Model 
13 A typical phone conversation is marked by periods of active talking / talk spurts (ON 
14 periods) interleaved by silence / listening periods (or OFF periods) as shown in Figure

2 In the model, the conditional probability of transitioning from state 1 (the active speech 
3 state) to state 0 (the inactive or silent state) while in state 1 is equal to a, while the 
4 conditional probability of transitioning from state 0 to state 1 while in state 0 is c. The 
5 model is assumed to be updated at the speech encoder frame rate R=1/T, where T is 
6 the encoder frame duration (typically, 20 ms). During the active state, packets of fixed 
7 sizes are generated at a regular interval. The size of packet and the rate at which the 
8 packets are sent depends on the corresponding voice codecs and compression 
9 schemes. Table 29 provides information on some common vocoders.

13 
14 Among the various vocoders in Table 29, a simplified AMR (Adaptive Multi-Rate) audio 
15 data compression model can be used to simplify the VoIP modeling process. AMR is 
16 optimized for speech coding and was adopted as the standard speech codec by 3GPP 
17 and widely used in GSM. The original AMR codec uses link adaptation to select from 
18 one of eight different bit rates based on link conditions. If the radio condition is bad, 
19 source coding is reduced (less bits to represent speech) and channel coding (stronger 
20 FEC) is increased. This improves the quality and robustness of the network condition 
21 while sacrificing some voice clarity. In the simplified version in this document, link 
22 adaptation has been disabled and the full rate of 12.2 kbps is used in the active state. 
23 This model captures the worst case scenario.

Table 30: VoIP Packet Calculation for AMR and G.729 
31 
32 Table 30 shows the VoIP packet size calculation for simplified AMR operation with or 
33 without header compression when using IPv4 or IPv6. In the table, the MAC CRC of 4B 
34 for ARQ is not included and only CRC for HARQ is included because the ARQ process 
can be assumed to be disabled for VoIP services. 
36 
37 To calculate the total packet size, MAC headers and CRC need to be accounted for 
38 (example: there are 6 bytes of MAC header and 2 bytes of HARQ CRC in IEEE 802.16e 
39 reference system). Without header compression, an AMR payload of 33 bytes is 
generated in the active state every 20 ms and an AMR payload of 7 bytes is generated 
41 in the inactive state every 160 ms. Assuming IPv4 and uncompressed headers, the 
42 resulting VoIP packet size is 81 bytes in the active mode and 55 bytes in the inactive 
43 mode.

1 The voice capacity assumes a 12.2. kbps codec with a 40% activity factor such that the 
2 percentage of users in outage is less than 3% where a user is defined to have 
3 experienced voice outage if more than 3% of the VoIP packets are dropped, erased or 
4 not delivered successfully to the user within the delay bound of 50 ms.

6 The packet delay is defined based on the 97 percentile of the CDF of all individual users

9 the individual user delay percentiles is obtained). 
10 
11 VoIP capacity is measured in Active Users/MHz/Sector. The number of active users is 
12 divided by total bandwidth occupied by the system accounting for frequency reuse. For 
13 an FDD configuration, the bandwidth is calculated as the sum of the uplink and downlink 
14 channel bandwidths. For a TDD configuration, the bandwidth is simply the channel 
15 bandwidth. 

16 10.3.2. VoIP Traffic Model Parameters 

17 During each call (each session), a VoIP user will be in the Active or Inactive state. The 
18 duration of each state is exponentially distributed. In the Active/Inactive state, packets of 
19 fixed sizes will be generated at a fixed interval. Hence, both the datagram size and 
20 datagram arrival intervals are fixed within a packet call. Table 31 shows parameters 
21 associated with the VoIP traffic model.

29 During the inactive state, we have chosen to generate comfort noise with smaller packet 
30 sizes at regular intervals instead of no packet transmission. This simplified model does 
31 not include a feature called hangover, which generates additional seven frames at the 
32 same rate as speech to ensure the correct estimation of comfort noise parameters at 
33 the receiver side even if there is a silence period at the end of a talk spurt (ON state),

1 and after the hangover period, a SID_FIRST frame is sent. The voice traffic model 
2 specifies only one rate during the ON state (talk spurt) of the AMR codec (12.2 kbps) 
3 and another rate for the comfort noise (SID_UPDATE) during the OFF state of the AMR 
4 codec. SID_UPDATE frames are generated every 8th frame during the silence period.

5 Each frame of video data arrives at a regular interval T. Each frame can be treated as a 
6 packet call and there will be zero OFF duration within a session. Within each frame 
7 (packet call), packets (or datagrams) arrive randomly and the packet sizes are random 
8 as well. 
9 


10 To counter the jittering effect caused by the random packet arrival rate within a frame at 
11 the MS, the MS uses a de-jitter buffer window to guarantee a continuous display of 
12 video streaming data. The de-jitter buffer window for video streaming service is 5 
13 seconds. At the beginning of the simulation, the MS de-jitter buffer shall be full with 
14 video data. During simulation, data is leaked out of this buffer at the source video data 
15 rate and filled as DL traffic reaches the MS from the BS. As a performance criterion, the 
16 simulation shall record the length of time, if any, during which the de-jitter buffer runs 
17 dry.

7 10.4.2. Hybrid Statistical- Trace Based Model 
8 A typical business-quality video streaming run can deliver TV-quality video at 25 to 30 
9 frames per second. There are several types of video compression technologies such as 
10 H.264, H.263 and H.261. H.264 is the next-generation video compression technology in 
11 the MPEG-4 standard, and it surpasses H.261 and H.263 in terms of video quality, 
12 effective compression and resilience to transmission losses, giving it the potential to 
13 halve the required bandwidth for digital video services over the internet or wireless 
14 networks. H.264 is likely to be used in applications such as Video Streaming, Video 
15 Conferencing Mobile devices, Tele-Medicine etc and current 3G mobiles use a derivate 
16 of MPEG-4. 
17 
18 MPEG compressed videos are composed of pictures (frames) that are separated into 
19 three different types: I, B, and P. I frames are intraframes that encode the current 
20 picture, while B and P frames interpolate from previous and future frames. MPEG-4 
21 video traffic modeling with separate set of I, B, and P frames form a final model that 
22 looks very similar to the original [63][64]. 
23 
24 An important feature of common MPEG encoders is the manner in which frame types 
25 are generated. Although not required by the standards, typical encoders use a fixed 
26 Group-of-Pictures (GOP) pattern when compressing a video sequence (the GOP 
27 pattern specifies the number and temporal order of P and B frames between two 
28 successive I frames). Quite often the fixed GOP pattern is “regular” in the sense that the 
29 number of B frames between two reference frames (I or P) is fixed. Such a GOP pattern 
30 can be characterized by two parameters: the I-to-I frame distance (N), and the I-to-P 
31 frame distance (M) (if no P frames are used, then M = N). 

108

1 10.4.2.1. I Frame 
2 It is observed that I frames exhibit different VBR dynamics at different time scales. At a 
3 time scale of the order of few seconds, the bit rate fluctuates in small amounts about 
4 some mean level, which itself varies drastically at a larger time scale. The fluctuations in 
5 the mean levels at the larger time scale are often attributed to “scene” changes. 
6 Incorporating a “scenic” component in a traffic model gives the VBR dynamics a 
7 physical interpretation and often leads to better performance predictions, and the scene 
8 length distribution can be appropriately fitted by an exponential (or geometric) 
9 distribution [65]. Summary statistics of the computed scene lengths for the trace of 
10 Silence of the Lambs are given in Table 34.

15 10.4.2.2. P and B Frames 
16 The sizes of P and B frames can be appropriately characterized by lognormal

17 distributions with parameters PP and BB respectively. Although the empirical 
18 frame sizes for P frames (also B frames) are correlated, these correlations are 
19 negligible compared to the correlations between different types of frames [63]. 

20 10.4.2.3. Video Streaming Traffic Model 
21 For the video streaming traffic model, a high quality movie trace, Silence of the Lambs 
22 [66], is used and two different resolutions for the display have been considered; 
23 176x144 for a small device and 320x240 for a large device. The required bandwidth for 
24 the uncompressed video stream with 176x144 pixels and 8 bit color depth is about 7.6 
25 Mbps and with 320x240 pixels and 8 bit color depth is about 23 Mbps. To minimize the 
26 effects of the non-uniform delay between the packets, a buffer is used at the user 
27 device to guarantee a continuous and smooth display of the video streaming data. For 
28 video streaming services, this buffer is set to 5 seconds. The algorithm generating 
29 synthetic MPEG stream is described in [63].

4 10.4.2.4. Performance Criteria for Near Real Time Video 
5 Video playout buffers introduce a delay between the receipt of frames and the frame 
6 playout. This absorbs variations in the data arrival pattern and permits a continuous 
7 playout of the frames. The actual design of these playout buffers involves a number of 
8 factors (including reset policies when the buffer runs dry) and is specific to the mobile. 
9 To avoid modeling such implementation details, we focus on what the BS scheduler 
10 must do to generally accommodate this continuous playout. Therefore, the scheduler 
11 should transmit an entire video frame within 5 second of receipt of the entire frame (i.e., 
12 receipt of the last octet of the last slice of the frame). If a frame exceeds the 5-second 
13 requirement, the scheduler discards the remainder of the frame that has not yet been 
14 transmitted. The size and arrival statistics for the video frames are defined in 
15 Table 35. 

110 



2007-08-28 IEEE C802.16m-07/080r3 

1 The performance requirement is that the fraction of video frames that are not completely 

2 transmitted within 5 seconds of their arrival at the scheduler shall be less than 2% for 

3 each user. The system outage requirement is such that no more than 3% of users can 

4 be in outage.

8 10.4.3. Trace Based Model 
9 There is no silver bullet on the synthetic traffic generation for streaming video. Multiple 
analytical algorithms are proposed but no single reference algorithm is ideal for the task. 
11 Generally, long rang dependency is recognized for the probability distributions of frame 
12 sizes. By using self-similar traffic generator, some of the characteristics of the 
13 streaming video traffic can be reproduced. However, the synthetic video traces 
14 generated by the analytical model are so different from the reference traces that it is 
difficult to convince people that synthetic traces have captured the core characteristics 
16 of the streaming video traffic. 
17 
18 Since the streaming video traces are easy to get and they are easy to use in the 
19 simulation environment, a trace based streaming video traffic model is recommended. 
In this model, a set of 12 MPEG4 traces are selected from the ASU video library. They 
21 are representative of the typical mix supported in the network. Among the 12 traces, 6 
22 of them are from the major movie genre, such as drama, action, SciFi, and carton; 2 of 
23 them are from major sport events; 1 is from MTV, 2 are from talk show with and without 
24 commercial, and 1 is from TV sitcom. The key characters of these streaming video 
traces are listed in the table below.

5 10.5. Video Telephony 
6 Based on the compression efficiency and market acceptance as described in the 
7 section 10.4, MPEG 4 has been selected for the video codec. The estimated values for 
8 the parameters to model a video stream vary from one trace to another. For parameters 
9 associated with the statistical distributions, the estimates depend strongly on the 
10 dimensions of the captured frames. For the video telephony traffic model, medium 
11 quality of an Office Cam trace is used and the trace library is available at [60]. For the 
12 traffic model two different qualities for the video have been considered; high and 
13 medium quality. For the medium quality encoding the quantization parameters for all 
14 three frame types were fixed at 10, and for the high quality encoding the quantization 
15 parameters for all three frame types were fixed at 4 [61]. 
16 
17 The scene length for the video telephony is assumed to be the entire application 
18 session since the background or the main subject may not be so dynamic.

3 10.6. Gaming traffic model 
4 Gaming is a rapidly growing application embedded into communication devices, and 
5 thus wireless gaming needs to be considered. Games in different genre, such as First 
6 Person Shooter (FPS), Role Play Game (RPG), etc., show dramatic different traffic 
7 behaviors. FPS model is recommended to represent the gaming traffic model in this 
8 document because it posts additional requirements to the system performance, such as 
9 real time delay with irregular traffic arrivals. 
10 
11 First Person Shooter (FPS) is a genre of video games. It is a good representation of the 
12 modern Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) game. Due to the nature of the FPS 
13 game, it has stringent network delay requirement. For the FPS game, if the client to 
14 server to client round trip delay (i.e., ping time, or end to end delay) is below 150 ms, 
15 the delay is considered excellent. When the delay is between 150 ms to 200 ms, the 
16 delay is noticeable especially to the experienced player. It is considered good or 
17 playable. When ping time is beyond 200 ms, the delay becomes intolerable. 
18 
19 This end to end delay budget can be break down into internet delay, server processing 
20 delay, cellular network delay, air interface delay, and client processing delay, etc. Let 
21 the IP packet delay be the time that the IP packet entering the MAC SDU buffer to the 
22 time that the IP packet is received by the client HARQ and reassembled into IP packet. 
23 The IP packet delay is typically budgeted as 50 ms to meet the 200 ms end to end 

113 



2007-08-28 IEEE C802.16m-07/080r3 
1 delay. A gamer is considered in outage if 10% of its packet delay is either lost or 
2 delayed beyond the budget, i.e., 50 ms. 
3 
4 The FPS traffic can be modeled by the Largest Extreme Value distribution. The starting 
5 time of a network gaming mobile is uniformly distributed between 0 and 40 ms to 
6 simulate the random timing relationship between client traffic packet arrival and reverse 
7 link frame boundary. The parameters of initial packet arrival time, the packet inter 
8 arrival time, and the packet sizes are illustrated in Table 38.

12 10.7. Traffic Mixes 

13 A mobile broadband wireless system is expected to support a mix of simultaneous 
14 traffic types. There can be different types of usage scenarios (multi-service v. single1
5 type), different types of devices (notebook PCs, vs. PDAs or smart phones), different 
16 usage levels (intense vs. light) and different delay/latency requirements (real-time vs. 
17 best-effort). 

18 The previous sections are primarily concerned with the traffic models for each of the 
19 potential traffic types. As discussed in the previous section, these models are based on 
20 statistical analysis of measured traffic that yielded some invariant patterns that are not 
21 very dependant on the specific system. It is more difficult to describe a similar invariant 
22 mix of traffic types since these tend to depend more heavily on the type of system and 
23 the actual deployment mix of user device types. 

24 In the context of system performance evaluation, using traffic models, the specific 
25 traffic-mix should emphasize different aspects of the system performance, e.g. 

114 



2007-08-28 IEEE C802.16m-07/080r3 

sustained throughput for file downloads v. faster response times for interactive 
applications. 

Table 39 contains traffic mixes that should be used in system evaluations 
For system level simulation purposes, “traffic mix” refers to the percentage of users in 
the system generating a particular type of traffic. In this context, each user is assumed 
to be generating only one type of traffic, recognizing that in an actual network a single 
user’s terminal could support multiple applications and generate several types of traffic 
simultaneously.

55 1. The system is modeled as a network of 7 clusters. Each cluster has 19 
56 hexagonal cells with six cells of the first tier and twelve cells of the second tier 
57 surround the central cell of each cluster. Each cell has three sectors. Frequency 
58 reuse is modeled by planning frequency allocations in different sectors in the 
59 network 

60 2. MSs are dropped uniformly throughout the system. Each mobile corresponds to 
61 an active user session that runs for the duration of the drop. 

62 3. Mobiles are randomly assigned channel models. Depending on the simulation, 
63 these may be in support of a desired channel model mix, or separate statistical 
64 realizations of a single type of channel model.

1 4. MSs are dropped according to the specified traffic mix. The simulation runs are 
2 done with an increment of MSs per sector until a termination condition is met as 
3 shown in Figure 27. 

4 5. For sectors belonging to the center cluster, sector assignment to an MS is based 
5 on the received power at an MS from all potential serving sectors. The sector 
6 with best path to MS, taking into account slow fading characteristics (path loss, 
7 shadowing, and antenna gains) is chosen as the serving sector. 

8 6. Mobile stations are randomly dropped over the 57 sectors such that each sector 
9 has the required numbers of users. Although users may be in regions supporting 
10 handover each user is assigned to only one sector for counting purposes. All 
11 sectors of the system shall continue accepting users until the desired fixed 
12 number of users per sector is achieved everywhere. Users dropped within 35 
13 meters of a sector antenna shall be redropped. MS locations for six wrapping 
14 clusters are the same as the center cluster. 

15 7. Fading signal and fading interference are computed from each mobile station into 
16 each sector and from each sector to each mobile for each simulation interval. 

17 8. Packets are not blocked when they arrive into the system (i.e. queue depths are 
18 infinite).Users with a required traffic class shall be modeled according to the 
19 traffic models defined in this document. Start times for each traffic type for each 
20 user should be randomized as specified in the traffic model being simulated. 

21 9. Packets are scheduled with a packet scheduler using the required fairness 
22 metric. Channel quality feedback delay, PDU errors and ARQ are modeled and 
23 packets are retransmitted as necessary. The ARQ process is modeled by 
24 explicitly rescheduling a packet as part of the current packet call after a specified 
25 ARQ feedback delay period. 
26 10..Simulation time is chosen to ensure convergence in user performance metrics. 
27 For a given drop the simulation is run for this duration, and then the process is 
28 repeated again, with the MSs dropped at new random locations. A sufficient 
29 number of drops are simulated to ensure convergence in the system 
30 performance metrics. 
31 11.Performance statistics are collected for MSs in all cells according to the output 
32 matrix requirements. 
33 12.All 57 sectors in the system shall be dynamically simulated.

37 The reuse of frequencies through planned allocation enables a cellular system to 
38 increase capacity with a limited number of channels. The interference model due to 
39 frequency reuse should accurately represent the time-frequency selective nature of 
40 OFDMA interference. The channel matrices for the desired and interfering signals shall 
41 be generated according to the models in Section 3 which account for the pathloss, BS

1 antenna gain, shadowing, and fast fading variations. For simplicity, the same fast 
2 fading channel model but a different realization shall be assigned to each link between 
3 an MS & all BSs in the network. This time-frequency modeling can create significant 
4 computational complexity in network simulations. To reduce complexity, pathloss and 
shadowing are calculated to determine the I strongest interferers. The strongest 

strong 

6 interferers are modeled as spatially correlated processes and their channel matrices 
7 include pathloss, BS antenna gain, shadowing and fast fading components. The 
8 remaining I weak interferers are modeled as spatially white spectrally flat processes. It has 
9 been shown that this modeling procedure results in negligible loss in performance. 

The procedure for downlink simulations is summarized below: 

11 1. Determine the pathloss, BS antenna gain, and shadowing from all interfering 
12 sectors to MS. 

13 2. Rank the interfering sectors in order of received power (based on pathloss, BS 
14 antenna gain, and shadowing). 

3. Model the channels of the strongest ( I ) interferers as described in Section 3. 

strong 

16 The channel matrices of the strongest interfering sectors account for the 
17 pathloss, BS antenna gain, shadowing, and fast fading variations. For downlink 
18 baseline simulations with Matrix A and Matrix B, the value of I shall be set to 

strong 

19 8. 

4. Model the remaining sectors as spatially white Gaussian noise processes whose 
21 variances are based on a spectrally flat Rayleigh fading process. The power of 
22 the Rayleigh fading process includes the effects of pathloss, BS antenna gain, 
23 and shadowing. The fading processes for all links between MS and BS are 
24 assumed to be independent, and the Doppler rate is determined by the speed of 
the mobile. At any instant in time, the total received interference power is the 
26 summation of the receive power from of all weak interferers. Hence, the 
27 interference power is varying in time during a simulation drop.
